| .NET C# | | I got into .Net and C# since before it ever became a thing.  It all started some 30 years ago in 1986 school year, a computer club where we could stay after school and program in BASIC on an Apple computer.  Since then I have watched it evolve into an interpreter Basic and Visual Basic along with big stint in vbs and js scripting.  vbs and asp were the origins of VB.NET and ASP.NET in 2003 amd 2005.  On of my first pieces is still in use today and that is the [UserManager in C0DEC0RE](https://github.com/mmeents/DataMattei/blob/master/C0DEC0RE/MMWebSiteUsers.cs).  I put it together in 2003 and it has served across 6 different websites.    |
