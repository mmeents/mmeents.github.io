##### a little about me and my Tech.
| Core Tech |  |  Experience|
| --- | --- | --- |
|.NET C# | many years | I got into .Net and C# since before it ever became a thing.  It all started more than 30 years ago in the 1986 school year, a computer club where we could stay after school and program in BASIC on an Apple computer.  Since then I have watched it evolve into an interpreter Basic and Visual Basic along with big stint in vbs and js scripting.  vbs and asp were the origins of VB.NET and ASP.NET in 2003 and 2005.  One of my first pieces is still in use today and that is the [UserManager in C0DEC0RE](https://github.com/mmeents/DataMattei/blob/master/C0DEC0RE/MMWebSiteUsers.cs).  I put it together in 2003 and it has served across 6 different websites. |

|SQL Queries | 19 years | I have written all types of queries with many types of data.  I am comfortable with cross-server, cross-database referencing, query development, performance optimizaion, profiling, Reporting, view, function and procedure function development. I published a [database workshow](https://github.com/mmeents/DataMattei/tree/master/dbWorkshopDemo) application in which I use it to produce commonly used stored procedures and cursors all via querying the database server for the data types.  | 
| | | |
|Database & SQL Server Admin| 19 years |Database Deployment and operation are a specialty of mine.  Database are a part of just about every project I have worked on.  I have experience with backup automization and extraction. | 
| | | | 
|JavaScript Framework | 20 years | I use it mostly in web browsers to script mouse clicks to a callbacks. run data validation and resizing, dynamic layout of controls within a browser.  that hasn't always been the case, years ago we used jscript from shell to launch dts procedures on a scheduler.  it has lost that job to C# now.  | 
| | | | 
|Entity Framework | 3 years |Used Entity framework on a number of projects that I had to adopt.  I think the Enterprise Library approach was the better approach.  It all about accessing data in databases and what you want to do with it.  In [C0DEC0RE](https://github.com/mmeents/DataMattei), I condensed all the pieces of Microsofts Enterprise Libary to connect and extract DataSet data. |

|Responsive Web Design | 5 years | I have been using Bootstrap since 2013 or so when I was introduced to its capabilities at an event at Microsoft in NYC.  I have been using it for all website development since.  Responsive design means looking consistent across different devices but it also means performance and not letting the user wait. which is usually resolved via SQL.    | 
| | | | 

|UX Design| years | The process of refining the user experience towards simplification and creates a desire to use the new system.   | 
| | | | 

|IIS | |Website Security lockdown, deployment and operation of websites on IIS.  I produced and operated MA3000.com, MasterLinkPro and Blueskymls websites.  MA3000.com was the formal training ground.  As well as produced Installs and Installer for remote deployment of WebCalendar Website to the law firms using it. | 
| | | | 
|Debugging | many years |Debugging is core to the art of software enginerring.  Debuggers allow you to inspec and find needles in haystacks.  Today we have many tools within the debuggin arsonal.  Unit testing. Browser Debugger tools, Visual Studio tools.  I am well versed in them and code with debugging in mind.      | 
| | | | 
|Version Control| many | Over the years I have had the oppertunity to use many Repository tools. CVS, SVN, TFS and lately well GitHub.  I have a tone of experience using them and the Wiki formatted documentation that is capable within.   |
