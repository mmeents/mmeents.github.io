##### a little about me and my Tech.
| Core Tech |  |  Experience|
| --- | --- | --- |
|.NET C# | many years | I got into .Net and C# since before it ever became a thing.  It all started more than 30 years ago in 1986 school year, a computer club where we could stay after school and program in BASIC on an Apple computer.  Since then I have watched it evolve into an interpreter Basic and Visual Basic along with big stint in vbs and js scripting.  vbs and asp were the origins of VB.NET and ASP.NET in 2003 and 2005.  One of my first pieces is still in use today and that is the [UserManager in C0DEC0RE](https://github.com/mmeents/DataMattei/blob/master/C0DEC0RE/MMWebSiteUsers.cs).  I put it together in 2003 and it has served across 6 different websites. |

|JavaScript Framework \(AngularJS\) | 20 years | Javascript goes back pretty far, sure not like 86 but 98 for me.  I remember seeing it as being a core component of this thing called the world wide web.  Javascript could be used to script any of the DOM objects but is mostly used for data validation and advanced resizing, layout control. AngularJS is a different story, interesting overlay; I have yet to find the need for it.  | 
| | | | 
|Entity Framework | 3 years |Used Entity framework on a number of projects that I had to adopt.  I think the Enterprise Library approach was the better approach and only rarely look back.  It all comes down to accessing data in databases and what you want to do with it.  In [C0DEC0RE](https://github.com/mmeents/DataMattei), I condensed all the pieces of Microsofts Enterprise Libary to connect and extract DataSet data. | 
| | | | 
|Responsive Web Design | 5 years | I have been using Bootstrap since 2013 or so when I was introduced to its capabilities at an event at Microsoft in NYC.  I have been using it for all website development since.  Responsive design means looking consistent across different devices but it also means performance and not letting the user wait. which is usually resolved via SQL.    | 
| | | | 
|SQL Queries | 19 years | I have written all types of queries with many types of data.  I am comfortable with cross-server, cross-database referencing.  I published a [database workshow](https://github.com/mmeents/DataMattei/tree/master/dbWorkshopDemo) application in which I use it to produce commonly used stored procedures and cursors all via querying the database server for the data types.  | 
| | | | 
|UX Design| years | The process of refining the user experience towards simplification and creates a desire to use the new system.   | 
| | | | 
|Database & SQL Server Admin| 19 years |I consider Database Deployment and opeartion to be a speciality of mine.  Database are a part of just about every project I have worked on. | 
| | | | 
|IIS | |Operational Security lockdown, deployment and operation of websites on Internet Information System.  I produced and operated MA3000.com, MasterLinkPro and Blueskymls websites.  As wel as produced Installs and Installer for remote deploment of WebCalendar to law firms using it. | 
| | | | 
|ASP.NET Core| | An ASP.NET Core app is a console app that creates a web server in its Main method. I have yet to find a reason to use this technique. | 
| | | | 
|Designing Solutions based on requirements | | | 
| | | | 
|Debugging | many years |Debugging is core to the art of software enginerring.  Debuggers allow you to inspec and find needles in haystacks.  Today we have many tools within the debuggin arsonal.  Unit testing. Browser Debugger tools, Visual Studio tools.  I am well versed in them and code with debugging in mind.      | 
| | | | 
|Implementing development best practices| | | 
| | | | 
|Requirements Gathering | | | 
| | | | 
|Version Control| many | Over the years I have had the oppertunity to use many Repository tools. CVS, SVN, TFS and lately well GitHub.  I have a tone of experience using them and the Wiki formatted documentation that is capable within.   |
