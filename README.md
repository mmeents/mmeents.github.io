|.NET C# | many years | I got into .Net and C# since before it ever became a thing.  It all started more than 30 years ago in 1986 school year, a computer club where we could stay after school and program in BASIC on an Apple computer.  Since then I have watched it evolve into an interpreter Basic and Visual Basic along with big stint in vbs and js scripting.  vbs and asp were the origins of VB.NET and ASP.NET in 2003 amd 2005.  On of my first pieces is still in use today and that is the [UserManager in C0DEC0RE](https://github.com/mmeents/DataMattei/blob/master/C0DEC0RE/MMWebSiteUsers.cs).  I put it together in 2003 and it has served across 6 different websites. | 
|JavaScript Framework \(AngularJS\) | 20 years | Javascipt goes back pretty far, sure not like 86 but 98 for me.  I remeber seeing it as being a core component of this thing called the world wide web.  Javascript could be use to script any of the DOM objects but is mostly used for data validation and advanced resizing, layout control. AngularJS is a different story, interesting overlay; I have yet to find the need for it.  | 
|Entity Framework | 3 years |I have used Entity framework on a number of projects that I had to adopt.  I think Enterprise Library approach was the better approach and only rairly look back.  It all comes down to accessing data in databases and what you want to do with it.  In (C0DEC0RE)[https://github.com/mmeents/DataMattei], I condenced all the pieces of Enterprise Libary to connect and extract DataSet data. |
